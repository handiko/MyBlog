Hello, this is my new "blog". I'll write in this blog whenever i do a project which i host in my github repositories. The languages i'll be using are English or Bahasa, depends on my mood or needs. Each entries will be written as a different markdown file and will be indexed here.

Actually i have another blog ([here](https://labsdl.wordpress.com/)) but because i am "lazy", i stop writting there and start to write here. It is easier for me to make a repository and blogging about my projects in one place.
